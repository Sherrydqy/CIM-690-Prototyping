            <p class="shortP">My yearning for exploring the best way to connect humans and computers seamlessly and frictionlessly encouraged me to delve deeper into the communication between human and technology. For starter, I want to broaden my knowledge of social cognition and systematic user research methods through graduate study to fill in the gaps and gain experience. Going forward, my goal after graduating is pursuing a career concentrated on invisible user experience design. Finally, I want to achieve my ultimate dream of creating a product with an intrinsically intuitive interface, which can not only help but also understand human by comprehending the tone and cadence of their voice so that it could better react to more specific user context. In this way, I can truly <strong>entwine the threads of technology, information and data into the seams of our day to day activities.</strong></p>
